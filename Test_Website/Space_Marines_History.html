        <h3>Origins</h3>
        The Space Marines are the Imperium of Man's supreme warriors. Genetically enhanced to be the ultimate soldiers of Mankind, they are far stronger and more resilient than ordinary human beings.
        Space Marines are organised into roughly a thousand Chapters, with each Chapter numbering approximately 1000 warriors organised into ten companies of 100 troops each.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each Chapter is a self-sufficient Imperial army, equipped with its own spacecraft and capable of responding at a moment's notice to any threat to the security of the Imperium.
        Every Chapter is fiercely proud of its history and achievements, and each one has its own distinctive colours and heraldic markings. These were established at the Chapter's Founding and are
        displayed with pride upon all of its armour and vehicles.
        <br>
        <br>
        All of the wargear of the Space Marines is painstakingly maintained, and many items are covered in lines of intricately rendered devotional script in High Gothic, each line detailing a battle honour won in a glorious campaign.
        A Space Marine is a towering, transhuman warrior, his brute strength tempered by inhuman skill. He is armed with the fearsome Bolter, a blessed weapon that fires devastating, mass-reactive shells that explode within the flesh of the target.
        He is protected by a suit of Power Armour, shielding him from the fiercest of enemy fire whilst simultaneously strengthening his blows and allowing him to survive the most hostile of environments.
        <br>
        <br>
        He is the product of intensive training and genetic manipulation, which transforms mortal men selected from the deadliest warrior races in the known galaxy into the most lethal of superhuman killing machines in Mankind's arsenal.

             title="Ancient Thunder Warrior during the Age of Strive">
        <h3>The Thunder Warriors</h3>
        The Space Marines can trace their origins back to the Unification Wars on Terra in the late 30th Millennium, when the Emperor of Mankind first revealed His existence and led regiments of deadly
        genetically-engineered soldiers known as Thunder Warriors in a great campaign to unite all of the myriad techno-barbarian tribes and nation-states of Old Earth under his rule.
        <br>
        <br>
        From the outset of his retaking of Terra, the Emperor employed genetically modified warriors within His forces and in these early enhanced troops lay the origins of what would later become
        the Space Marine Legions. During the Age of Strife, known as "Old Night" on Terra, the cradle of Mankind had seen more than its fair share of augments and "super" soldiers created both from
        the bio-alchemy of genetic engineering and cybernetic augmentation. But it was the Emperor's own Thunder Warriors, named for the early thunderbolt and raptor's head heraldry used by their
        master in the Imperium's earliest days, that were to prove superior to all of them.
        <br>
        <br>
        These superhuman warriors were a gestalt mix of unprecedented superhuman physical power, gene-programmed resistance to environmental and even psychic attack, a warlike spirit and the Emperor's
        own strategic genius. The Thunder Regiments were an army unlike any that had come before them, and the forces of the powerful tyrants of Old Earth had nothing to match them.
        <br>
        <br>
        This Unification of humanity's homeworld marked the beginning of the Imperium of Man and the Emperor's quest to reunite all of humanity under a single interstellar government.
        This quest was intended to prevent His species' extinction from the growing threats which confronted the human-settled galaxy in the wake of the Age of Strife. But despite their many early victories
        in the Unification Wars, the Thunder Warriors were far from perfect.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some were mentally unstable, others suffered catastrophic biological failure after an unprecedented span of years as their own superhuman physiques turning against them in the end. It seems obvious
        in retrospect that the Emperor knew early on that a more permanent and stable force of genetically enhanced warriors was needed, so even while the Thunder Warriors waged war in their early days the
        Emperor gathered about Him a team of savants and gene-wrights, some willing and others as captives taken from His foes, and constructed new genetics laboratories deep in the vast dungeons of the former
        Sigillite fortress He had taken on His own beneath the Himalazian (Himalayan) Mountains.
        <br>
        <br>
        Labour there went on for solar decades in absolute secrecy and resulted in the creation of the Primarchs and other wonders of gene-craft known and unknown. Foremost amongst these were the Space Marine
        Legions, the Legiones Astartes. Into their creation went all the secret history and genetic lore of the Age of Strife, hard wisdom gained through the success and failure of the Thunder Warriors and the
        Emperor's own unparalleled genius.

        <h3>The Grey Legions</h3>
        <div id="Orsan_Quote" align="center">
        <i>"Before this Age, it was said of heroes that they were not born, but created, forged in the fires of adversity and war. In these days in which we now live, however, heroes are indeed born, in the
        gene-forges of the Emperor's genius. To be a hero amongst such warriors as these is true achievement, and one even the most elevated of our forebears could never have dreamed of."</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        --- Orsan Lakk, late of the <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Remembrancer">Order of Remembrancers</a> ---</div>
        <br>
        <br>
        The first among the Space Marines were hand-picked men drawn from the Emperor's personal bodyguard. These volunteers were subjected to surgical, genetic and psychological modification.
        <br>
        <br>
        With rigorous training and appropriate mental conditioning they became not only immensely strong and tough, but iron-willed and disciplined, no longer prone to the psychological damage that normally
        affected humans facing the stress of constant combat. They were an unstoppable force whose loyalty to the Emperor was unflinching. Quickly the process was refined and systematised, and the numbers of
        the new enhanced warriors, at first armed and armoured as the Thunder Warriors had been, grew swiftly.

                    Of particular note is the use of yellow heraldry on several segments of the Legionary's armour; limited to the right arm and shoulder, this dates the Legionary's original induction to just after the Fall of Roma.</i></font>

        <br>
        The first Astartes were organised into twenty distinct regiments numbering no more than a few hundred warriors each. Although it remained a dire secret at the time, it is now widely believed that
        this division was more than a merely administrative one, as each regiment contained variant "gene-seed" encoding drawn from a different primogenitor Primarch.
        <br>
        <br>
        This often manifested its influence in subtle and unexpected ways, not least of all in influencing the psychological character of the genetically enhanced warriors.  With the regiments expanding
        rapidly into full Legions with the intake of new blood from the areas of Terra that had already joined cause with the Emperor, the new warriors quickly eclipsed and replaced the mighty but far
        less-disciplined and mentally unstable Thunder Warriors. As the proto-Space Marine Legions were unleashed in the latter days of the Unification Wars, victory followed victory in quick succession.
        <br>
        <br>
        As time went on, the Space Marine regiments became Legions as the Emperor recruited young men from amongst the newly conquered tribes of Old Earth and the hundreds of Astartes in service to the
        Imperium swiftly became tens of thousands. These superhuman troops dominated the final days of the Wars of Unification, easily defeating all their Terran opponents and forcing those among the
        Tech-priests of Mars who had intervened in the conflict on Terra to delay the Emperor's victory to sue for peace.

        These superhuman troops dominated the final days of the Wars of Unification, easily defeating all their Terran opponents and forcing those among the Tech-priests of Mars who had intervened in
        the conflict on Terra to delay the Emperor's victory to sue for peace. But in truth, the victories of the early Space Marines created a new problem within the Imperial fold. The Emperor had been
        right to be worried about His earlier creations, the Thunder Warriors.
        <br>
        <br>
        One ancient source claims that even before the Unification Wars had ended, the Thunder Warriors, already jealous of their replacements' long lives, at last realised that their creator had cursed
        them with short lifespans as a result of their imperfect genetic augmentations. In their rage and fear, they turned upon Him for what they saw as His betrayal. It was a cadre of several hundred
        Custodians of the Legio Custodes, the Emperor's bodyguard, even then believed to have been led by the legendary Constantin Valdor, and accompanied by several thousand prototype Astartes of the
        I Legion of the newborn Space Marines, that stood in the Emperor's defence, carrying out a merciless culling of the obsolete and rebellious gene-soldiers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite such tragedies, the Space Marines fought with righteous zeal and it was they who first referred to their mission as a "Crusade." By their efforts, for the first time in unrecorded millennia,
        the Earth was united under the rule of one man. The armour they wore was not new, but the same partially powered armour that had evolved on Old Earth and was worn by the elite of both the Emperor's
        armies and the techno-barbarian tribes that had fought against Him.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of this "Thunder Armour," first named for the Thunder Regiments that were the Legions' forebears, was newly forged, but the Emperor's warsmiths also took or cannibalised many suits from the
        armouries and corpses of conquered foes. As if to mark a break from the wars of the past, the armour of the first Astartes was cast in storm cloud grey, and bore only the thunderbolt and lightning
        marks of Imperial Unity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Over time, the Space Marine Legions gained their own marks of distinction and character. Names, Emperor-given in some cases, others by the Primarchs, came to replace the Legions' original numbers,
        with many Space Marine companies seeking to single themselves out from their brother Legions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Battle honours were accumulated and the effect of each Legion's character worked upon them, so that as the Legions expanded to conquer the galaxy, storm cloud grey became granite, silver, viridian,
        sable, gold, ocean, ash or ice, and by the time of the Triumph of Ullanor, the "Grey Legions" of the  Unification era were gone, lost to history.
