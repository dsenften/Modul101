        <h3>First Founding</h3>
        The Space Marines were originally divided into 20 large Legions created during the First Founding by the Emperor, and each Legion was filled with thousands of Space Marines whose gene-seed was
        based on genetic material drawn from one of the original Primarchs.
        <br>
        <br>
        When 18 of the 20 original Primarchs were rediscovered during the Great Crusade, they became the commanders of the Legion genetically related to them.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the Horus Heresy half of the Legions turned Traitor to the Imperium and swore themselves to the Ruinous Powers of Chaos, becoming the 9 Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Loyalist Legions</h3>
        Those Astartes Legions that remained loyal to the Emperor during the Horus Heresy were known as the "Loyalists." They were subsequently each split up into smaller Chapters of only 1,000 Space
        Marines each during the so-called Second Founding, one of which retained the name of the original Space Marine Legion.

                some of the Dark Angels turned to the service of Chaos during the Horus Heresy. These individuals are known as the Fallen Angels and the Dark Angels and the Unforgiven have vowed never to rest until all of the Fallen have repented or been killed in the Emperor's name.
